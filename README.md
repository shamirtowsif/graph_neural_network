You can customize the code to work with different datasets by modifying the dataset name in the following line: dataset = TUDataset(root='/tmp/DATASET_NAME', name='DATASET_NAME'). This allows you to easily switch between datasets such as PROTEINS, Cora, or MUTAG. The model is trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, weight decay of 5e-4, and a batch size of 32. The architecture includes two GCNConv layers that process the input features into 32-dimensional embeddings, followed by a fully connected layer to output the final class predictions. Training loss and test accuracy are logged every 10 epochs, with typical results reaching 70-80% accuracy on datasets like PROTEINS and MUTAG.
